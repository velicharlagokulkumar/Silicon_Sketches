## Basic Systolic Array Design

Design a simple 4x4 systolic array using SystemVerilog. The array should take two 4x4 staggered matrices as input and produce a 4x4 matrix as output, representing the matrix multiplication result.

Constraints:

    • The design should handle only 4x4 matrices.

    • Inputs and outputs should be unsigned integers.

    • The module should be synchronous with a clock and reset.

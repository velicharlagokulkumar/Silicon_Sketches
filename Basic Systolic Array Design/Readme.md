Design a simple 2x2 systolic array using SystemVerilog. The array should take two 2x2 matrices as input and produce a 2x2 matrix as output, representing the matrix multiplication result.

Constraints:

    • The design should handle only 2x2 matrices.

    • Inputs and outputs should be unsigned integers.

    • The module should be synchronous with a clock and reset.
